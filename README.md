1. This is a multiple regression model where we are trying to predict the sales in a store using various features.
2. The problem consists of multiple features who are correlated and thus creates inaccurate models.
3. The final model consists of just 2 features out of 5 and a R^2 value of 84% which is quite high and thus creates an effective model.
